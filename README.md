# Object Detection Project

## Overview
This project implements an object detection model that identifies and classifies objects in real-time or from static images. The model is trained using deep learning techniques and leverages a pre-trained network for enhanced accuracy and efficiency.

## Features
- Real-time object detection from a webcam or video feed
- Detection from static images
- Supports multiple object categories
- High accuracy using a pre-trained model (YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN)
- Custom dataset support for specialized use cases

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/SonamDobriyal1/object-detection.git
   cd object-detection
   
2. Install the required dependencies
  
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
   
4. Open the `objectdetection.ipynb` file and execute the cells step by step.

## Usage
- **Real-time Detection:** Run the script to start detecting objects using your webcam.
- **Image Detection:** Provide an image as input and get object detection results with bounding boxes.
- **Custom Training:** Train the model using your dataset for specific object detection needs.

## Model Information
- Uses a deep learning-based architecture (YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN)
- Pre-trained on COCO dataset (or a custom dataset)
- Outputs bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores

## Dataset
- Default model is trained on the COCO dataset.
- Users can fine-tune the model using a custom dataset by modifying the training pipeline.

## Results
- Displays detected objects with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
- Outputs images with marked objects.

## Future Improvements
- Improve real-time detection speed.
- Implement model optimization techniques (quantization, pruning).
- Enhance support for custom dataset training.
